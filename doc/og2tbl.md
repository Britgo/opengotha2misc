    Rename (normalise) column header name.

    Option may be given multiple times.

    Mappings supplied supplement or override the default mappings.

# DESCRIPTION

TBC.

# ASSUMPTIONS

- only one set of results per file
- columns do not change partway through
- round columns are ordered ascending from left to right
- a comment giving all or a subset of names of the columns precedes the data rows
- if a subset, the additional columns in the data are unused tiebreaks followed by the round results
- sample data indicates some column names get merged (e.g. SOSSOSOS means SOS followed by SOSOS)
- tiebreak columns are ordered left to right by precedence
- unused tiebreak columns appear to the right of used tiebreaks
- unused tiebreak columns may have "NONE" heading
- unlabelled unused tiebreak columns contain only "0" as data
- spaces in names are encoded by underscores which appear nowhere else
- names are split into exactly two columns: lastname firstname
- an absent name part is encoded by a single underscore (consider player "Weed")
- rows are in descending order of final placement of player in the tournament
- ties may be indicated by only the first of such rows being numbered explicitly
- row number is used as opponent number in results columns
- data rows may have a suffix "|"+number indicating EGD PIN

# CHOICES

- some columns names are normalised
- columns are reordered to place rounds after all others
- if short-long club mapping is provided, codes are expanded with unmatched codes placed inside square brackets
- "No Club" is replaced by "-"
- if there are tied placements, an additional column is prefixed
- EGD PIN info is elided
